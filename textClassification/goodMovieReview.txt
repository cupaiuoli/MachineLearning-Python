Ultimately the story is pretty simple, and there are a couple of contrivances run into along the way, but 1917 primarily exists as a technical achievement, and in that capacity it is a true marvel. The construction isn’t TOTALLY perfect, as the one-shot aesthetic isn’t seamless due to some fairly obvious cut points, but that hardly detracts from what’s being done in the big picture.

This is a case where a behind-the-scenes documentary may end up being as fascinating as the finished film itself, as there are certain camera maneuvers that are simultaneously breathtaking and mind-boggling to the point where thoughts of “How did they do that?” momentarily take you out of the cinematic journey. The perfect second viewing of this film would be a cut that is put side-by-side with footage taken from set that just follows everything that the main camera is doing during every shot.

As though executing the camera movement weren’t enough, the style also demands that scenes cannot be traditionally lit, with the added “bonus” being that it’s almost all set outside, and yet the work of Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins is still able to expose incredible color and atmosphere in the environments – with some of the most spectacular work coming when the sun has gone down and fire is the primary source of illumination.
